# Piper's Spyro 1 Experiments
In this repo, you'll find code scraps I've made while investigating Spyro the Dragon or while working on larger projects for the game. Anything posted here is provided in the hope it may be useful, but it may be unpolished, incompletely documented, or require careful handling. User Experience is usually not a priority and such documentation that exists may assume programming or game design knowledge. I'm committed to providing PAL support in my polished projects whenever possible, but the code found here may not work on PAL.

# Main Project(s)
If you're looking for a polished project, look here!

[LuaGhost](https://github.com/Piper1618/LuaGhost-for-Spyro-the-Dragon): A speedrun practice tool for Spyro the Dragon. This is where a lot of my code scraps have ended up so far.

# Spyro 1 Memory Map
[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12de_VZ1_mUvAwp96YNrhK3qrWadSmoOx4AcgN5dnlQY/edit?usp=sharing) is a memory map I've been working on during my explorations of Spyro's game mechanics and code. It's very far from complete and it's a working document, so I'm adding things as I find them and occasionally have to make corrections later.

# Where am I?
You can find me on [Twitter @piper1618](https://www.twitter.com/piper1618) or on [Twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/piper1618) where I stream various speedrunning content (including, but not limited to, Spyro) and casual playthroughs. My stream is intended to be a chill, harassment free zone for everyone to enjoy the games. Those are the main places I'm active.
